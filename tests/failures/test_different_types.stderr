  = note: expected struct `ProblemVariables<[closure@$DIR/src/variables_macro.rs:6:85: 6:89]>` (closure)
             found struct `ProblemVariables<[closure@$DIR/src/variables_macro.rs:6:85: 6:89]>` (closure)
  = note: no two closures, even if identical, have the same type
  = help: consider boxing your closure and/or using it as a trait object
