  = note: expected struct `good_lp::variable::ProblemVariables<[closure@$DIR/src/variable.rs:120:60: 120:64]>` (closure)
             found struct `good_lp::variable::ProblemVariables<[closure@$DIR/src/variable.rs:120:60: 120:64]>` (closure)
  = note: no two closures, even if identical, have the same type
  = help: consider boxing your closure and/or using it as a trait object
